# Project 3 Devlog

## Dec 10: 3:26pm
### Had a very late start to the project but I am going to zone in for at least 2 hours so hopefully I can make a good chunk of progress. I created the repo and python file, and moved the test.idx file to my project file to make it easier for testing. I plan to do the project in python, and I going to plan out how to approach it because I'm assuming the code will be a bit lengthy based on what we are doing.
