# Project 3 Devlog

## Dec 10: 3:26pm
### Had a very late start to the project but I am going to zone in for at least 2 hours so hopefully I can make a good chunk of progress. I created the repo and python file, and moved the test.idx file to my project file to make it easier for testing. I plan to do the project in python, and I going to plan out how to approach it because I'm assuming the code will be a bit lengthy based on what we are doing.

### To make it easier for me to understand my code logically and how it will be executed, I am going to have many methods implemented and helper functions that perform actions needed based on the commands I put. The main method will only take input from the user and identify the command given so that it calls the necessary functions to perform it. I'm going to create the outline of the main method first that will compose of if methods and include error handling with try if something wrong happens during execution. It will also help when I need to debug in the command line. So far the methods I know I need to implement is for insertion, search, reading/writing node, and printing. This is all I can think of for the methods for now.
